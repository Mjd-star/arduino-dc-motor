## Control a DC Motor with an Arduino

The objective of this circuit is to establish the basis to move the robot wheels, so that we utilize 2 DC motors that can be coded into two-dimensional rotation clock-sided & counterclock-sided. The simulation is performed with Tinckercad https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard .

## Hardware required
  one Arduino
  two DC motors
  one 9 volts Battery
  one H-bridge Motor Drive
